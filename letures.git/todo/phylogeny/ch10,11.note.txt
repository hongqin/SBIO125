key concepts

 tree topology
 newick format
 ultrametric tree
 rooted trees and unrooted trees
 additive distance matrix

 substitution models (Jukes Cantor model, Kimura 2-parameter model)
 synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions
 +/- selection
 mutation
 fixation
 divergence and polymorphism

Example of selection on fixation:
 iron coin, drop on a wall. then a magnet on one side of the wall. For the same mutation rate, fixation rate of advantageous mutation increases.
